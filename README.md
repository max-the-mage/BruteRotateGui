# BruteRotateGui
A program for rotating through all transliterlizations of runes from Liber Primus

## How to use

Clone the project to visual studio and open BruteRotateGui.sln
Type each rune transliteral, seperated by a period, and spaces for, well, spaces.
Transliterals that have multiple characters should be written like so: `ng(ing)`
Choose the amount of rotations and click rotate. The rotated text and respective prime numbers will then be shown.

For example
`x.i.x.m ng(ing).s(z)` with two rotations will output:
`TEOTNG(ING) DB` and `59 41 59 79  89 61`
